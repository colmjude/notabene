Currently takenote is a pain to get running locally.
Development is test driven so it is rarely run locally.

To test
	# run
		make remotes
	# open
		test/index.html
	# clap hands at all the passing tests

To develop on takenote
	# install yuicompressor-2.4.6.jar into root of directory (see http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/)
	# setup account on tiddlyspace.com
	# add to ~/.bash_profile the following line
			export TIDDLYSPACE_AUTH='-u myuser:mypass'
	# In Makefile replace
			./upload.sh takenotedev
		with
			./upload.sh <space>
	# run
		./make dev
	# then take a note.
	# Note the dev version doesn't deploy a cache manifest. make dist does
